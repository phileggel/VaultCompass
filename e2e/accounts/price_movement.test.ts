/**
 * E2E tests — Price Movement (PMV)
 *
 * Spec:     docs/spec/price-movement.md (PMV-010–061)
 * Contract: docs/contracts/asset-contract.md § "Asset Price Fetch Tasks",
 *           § Shared Types PriceMovementReport / PriceMovementRow,
 *           § Events AssetPriceFetchCompleted
 * Plan:     docs/plan/price-movement-plan.md §2.4
 *
 * Spec rules exercised by this file:
 *   PMV-010/015 — a Global refresh (trigger="Manual") is the only fetch path
 *                 that produces a report; the dialog appearing at all proves
 *                 the trigger reached the backend and the report round-tripped
 *                 through the real event bus, not a mock.
 *   PMV-013     — the report is presented as its own dialog on the accounts
 *                 list.
 *   PMV-018     — the same refresh leaves the asset unpriced, so the
 *                 unupdated-prices modal (MKT-172) opens too. The report waits
 *                 for it: no report dialog while that modal is up, and the
 *                 report is not lost — it opens once the modal clears.
 *   PMV-032/060 — an account whose only holding could never be priced is
 *                 marked incomplete; when that leaves nothing moved in the
 *                 whole portfolio the report states that plainly, together
 *                 with the incompleteness sentence, instead of an empty table.
 *   PMV-061     — dismissing the dialog removes it and it does not return.
 *
 * Seed strategy (determinism):
 *   Each E2E spec file runs in its own session against a fresh ephemeral DB
 *   (wdio.conf.ts beforeSession/afterSession — new VAULT_COMPASS_E2E_DATA_DIR
 *   per worker), so no other test file's accounts are present when this
 *   file's Global refresh runs; the report's rows are exactly what this file
 *   seeds.
 *
 *   One account holding one asset whose reference (ZZ-NOPE-PMV) Yahoo Finance
 *   cannot resolve (no exchange set, so MKT-110 branch 2 uses the bare
 *   reference as the symbol — the same technique as
 *   account_details/manual_price_fill.test.ts). Yahoo returns no data for it
 *   either online or offline (offline: the request times out), so the asset
 *   always lands in the MKT-114 skip set and the account's reading is always
 *   marked incomplete (PMV-032), regardless of network state. The holding has
 *   never had a price recorded, so both the "before" and "after" readings
 *   value it at 0 (a missing price contributes 0) and the account's value
 *   cannot move — "nothing moved" (PMV-060) is therefore the deterministic
 *   report state, online or offline.
 *
 *   That same unresolvable asset is what puts the unupdated-prices modal on
 *   screen (MKT-170), which is what makes the PMV-018 ordering observable here
 *   rather than needing a second scenario to provoke it.
 *
 * Why one scenario:
 *   The core cross-layer contract at E2E is:
 *     click Global refresh → trigger="Manual" reaches Rust → real
 *     capture/fetch/report pipeline → AssetPriceFetchCompleted carries a real
 *     PriceMovementReport → the report waits for the manual-fill modal → the
 *     dialog renders it → dismiss discards it for good.
 *   A single scenario that traverses this full path covers the critical
 *   integration points without duplicating the existing Vitest-level coverage
 *   of the PMV rules (18 dialog-rendering tests, 8 hook tests, 5 manager
 *   wiring tests) or the Rust resolution matrix (1263 lib tests).

 * valuation reads. In practice this completes in a few seconds because the
 * bogus symbol fails fast; the wide ceiling guards offline CI where the TCP
