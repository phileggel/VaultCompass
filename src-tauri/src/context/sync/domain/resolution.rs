//! The resolution engine (ADR-019, D4) — the single component that decides every CFR
//! outcome. Pure: no I/O, no sqlx, no clock, so a change to `sync-conflict-resolution.md`
//! is a change to this module alone (constraint 2). The apply executor
//! (`application::apply`) consumes the `Outcome` and `NoticeDraft`s this module returns and
//! never compares ranks, timestamps, or origins itself; the change recorder
//! (`infrastructure::change_log`) asks `local_write_allowed` before it records a local
//! write (CFR-016). The engine decides the kind of every merge, the owning repository
//! executes it: `Outcome::MergeMax` is carried out by the fee catch-up repository's SQL
//! `MAX()` over the stored and incoming period (CFR-044).
