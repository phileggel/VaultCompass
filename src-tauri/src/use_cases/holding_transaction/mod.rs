//! Holding-transaction use case.
//!
//! Single cross-context orchestrator covering every operation that mutates a `Holding`
//! through a `Transaction`: opening balance, buy, sell, correct, cancel. Injects
//! `AccountService` + `AssetService` once and shares them across all five methods.
//! Will use `ensure_cash_asset(currency)` (CSH-010 helper) once cash-tracking lands.

/// Tauri command handlers for transaction-recording operations.
mod api;
/// Cross-BC orchestrator (one struct, one method per operation).
mod orchestrator;
/// Shared helpers used by the orchestrator.
