# Roadmap — Financial Asset Lifecycle

This document maps every operation needed to cover the full lifecycle of a financial asset in VaultCompass, from catalog entry to position closure. It is a planning reference, not a spec — each phase links to the relevant spec(s) and todo items when they exist.

## Phase 3 — Position Monitoring

| Holdings reactivity           | ✅ Done    | Re-fetch on `TransactionUpdated` event (ACD-039)                     |
| Current market price (manual) | 🔲 Planned | Manual entry first; price feed as a separate later feature           |

| Unrealized P&L                | 🔲 Planned | `(current_price − average_price) × quantity`; depends on phase above |
| Performance %                 | 🔲 Planned | `unrealized_pnl / cost_basis × 100`                                  |
| Portfolio summary / dashboard | 🔲 Planned | Aggregate view across all accounts                                   |

Spec: `docs/spec/account-details.md`

---

## Phase 4 — Corporate Events

Non-trade events that alter quantity or value without a cash exchange at the position level.

| Operation            | Status     | Notes                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dividend             | 🔲 Planned | Cash income; does not change quantity; new transaction type needed  |
| Stock split          | 🔲 Planned | Multiplies quantity, divides price; requires dedicated operation    |
| Reverse split        | 🔲 Planned | Divides quantity, multiplies price                                  |
| Merger / acquisition | 🔲 Planned | Asset substitution; complex; out of scope until sell is implemented |

> None of these are specced yet. They require a new `transaction_type` enum and dedicated backend logic distinct from purchases and sales.

---

## Phase 5 — Disposition (Sell)

Record a sale that reduces or closes a position.

| Operation                    | Status  | Notes                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sell transaction type        | ✅ Done | `TransactionType::Sell` variant; backend + frontend (SEL-010)                      |

| Holding quantity decrease    | ✅ Done | `recalculate_holding` decreases qty on sell (SEL-025)                              |
| Sell validation              | ✅ Done | Oversell guard frontend + backend (SEL-021, SEL-022)                               |
| Realized P&L computation     | ✅ Done | `(sell_proceeds − vwap × qty)` crystallized at sell time (SEL-024)                 |
| Realized P&L display         | ✅ Done | Per sell row in transaction list + cumulated per holding in ACD (SEL-038, SEL-042) |
| Partial sell                 | ✅ Done | Holding remains open; VWAP unchanged by sells (SEL-027)                            |
| Edit/delete sell transaction | ✅ Done | Full chronological recalculation on edit/delete (SEL-030, SEL-031, SEL-033)        |

> Prerequisite: sell transaction type must be introduced before corporate events (phase 4) can be fully modelled.

---

## Phase 6 — Position Closure

A position is closed when `Holding.quantity` reaches zero.

| Operation                       | Status     | Notes                                                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero-quantity holding retention | ✅ Specced | Holding kept in DB at `quantity = 0`; `average_price` preserved (TRX-040)        |
| Closed position exclusion       | ✅ Done    | `quantity > 0` filter in Account Details (ACD-020)                               |
| "All positions closed" state    | ✅ Done    | Distinct empty-state message in Account Details (ACD-034)                        |
| Closed position history         | ✅ Done    | View past closed positions with realized P&L per position (ACD-044–ACD-050)      |
| Cumulative realized P&L         | ✅ Done    | `total_realized_pnl` summed across all holdings; shown in account summary header |

---

## Phase 7 — Archive

An asset can be archived once it has no active positions, preserving its historical data.

| Operation                  | Status  | Notes                                                                    |

| Auto-unarchive on new buy  | ✅ Done | Transparent to user, with confirmation dialog (TRX-028, TRX-029)         |
| Archive eligibility guard  | ✅ Done | Block archiving if any `Holding.quantity > 0` across all accounts (OQ-6) |
| Archived asset in holdings | ✅ Done | Included in Account Details as long as `quantity > 0` (ACD-021)          |

## Implementation Order (Recommended)

Based on value and dependency chain:

1. ~~**Delete confirmation UI**~~ — ✅ done
2. ~~**Transaction list view**~~ — ✅ done
3. ~~**Inline asset creation from Account Details**~~ — ✅ done
4. **Sell transaction** — unlocks phases 5 & 6; requires new spec
5. **Realized P&L** — follows sell; display per transaction and per position
6. **Archive eligibility guard** — depends on phase 5 (need sell to reach `qty = 0`)
7. **Current market price** — data source decision needed (manual vs. feed); standalone spec
8. **Unrealized P&L + performance %** — depends on market price
9. **Corporate events (dividends, splits)** — standalone spec; relatively independent
10. **Portfolio dashboard** — aggregation of phases 3–6; last to implement
