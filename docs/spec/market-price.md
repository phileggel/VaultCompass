# Business Rules — Market Price (MKT)

## Context

The Market Price feature allows users to record the current market value of a financial asset manually. It is the first phase of market price support; automated price feeds are a future feature that will slot into the same data model.

A price is recorded per asset (not per holding) and is timestamped: multiple entries can accumulate over time, one per date per asset. The Account Details view uses the most recently dated price to display the current value, unrealized gain/loss, and performance percentage for each active holding.

This spec is a **feature spec** spanning two domains: price recording belongs to the `asset` bounded context; display of current price and derived values extends the `use_cases/account_details/` use case. See `docs/spec/account-details.md` for the baseline Account Details behaviour that this spec extends.

By default, recording a buy or sell transaction does **not** automatically create a price record. `Transaction.unit_price` is the price transacted at (a cost-basis input); `AssetPrice.price` is the current market value of the asset. Conflating them by default would show cost as current price, making unrealized P&L meaningless. As an explicit opt-in (see MKT-050+), the user can choose — globally or per transaction — to also persist the transacted unit price as the asset's market price for the transaction date.

All financial values are stored as `i64` micro-units per [ADR-001](../adr/001-use-i64-for-monetary-amounts.md).

## Entity Definition

### AssetPrice

Represents a manually recorded market price for a financial asset on a specific date. Owned by the `asset` bounded context.

| Field      | Business meaning                                                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `asset_id` | The asset whose market price this record describes.                                |
| `date`     | The calendar date this price observation applies to (ISO 8601, e.g. `2026-04-26`). |
| `price`    | Market price per unit in the asset's native currency (i64 micros, ADR-001).        |

> The combination `(asset_id, date)` is unique: only one price per asset per day. Recording a second price for the same `(asset_id, date)` pair overwrites the first (MKT-025). Correction by re-recording remains valid. Standalone edit and delete of individual entries are also supported via the price history view (MKT-070+).

### HoldingDetail (extended)

The `HoldingDetail` DTO defined in the ACD spec gains five new fields populated by this feature.

| Field                | Business meaning                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `asset_currency`     | ISO 4217 currency code of the asset (e.g. `"USD"`). Required for the price label in the modal (MKT-023) and for the currency-mismatch check (MKT-034). Always present.                                 |
| `current_price`      | Most recently dated `AssetPrice.price` for this asset, in asset currency (i64 micros). `None` if no price has ever been recorded.                                                                      |
| `current_price_date` | ISO date string of the price observation used as `current_price`. `None` when `current_price` is `None`.                                                                                               |
| `unrealized_pnl`     | Unrealized gain or loss in account currency (i64 micros). `None` when no price exists or when asset and account currencies differ (MKT-034). `0` when current price equals average price (not `None`). |
| `performance_pct`    | `unrealized_pnl / cost_basis × 100`, expressed as i64 micros (e.g. 5.25 % = 5 250 000). `None` when `unrealized_pnl` is `None` or `cost_basis` is zero. `0` when `unrealized_pnl` is zero.             |

### AccountDetailsResponse (extended)

The `AccountDetailsResponse` DTO gains one new field.

| Field                  | Business meaning                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `total_unrealized_pnl` | Sum of `unrealized_pnl` (i64 micros) across all active holdings where a value is computable (same-currency with a recorded price). `None` when no holding has a computable value. |

---

## Business Rules

### Eligibility and Initiation (010–019)

**MKT-010 — Entry point (frontend)**: An "Enter price" action is available on each **active** holding row in the Account Details view, alongside the existing Buy and Sell actions. It is not shown on closed holdings.

**MKT-011 — Modal pre-fill — asset and date (frontend)**: Opening the "Enter price" form pre-fills the asset name as a read-only label and the date field with today's date (editable by the user, e.g. to backdate to yesterday's closing price).

**MKT-012 — Modal pre-fill — price (frontend)**: When `HoldingDetail.current_price_date` equals today's ISO date at the time the modal is opened, the price field is pre-filled with `HoldingDetail.current_price`. When the latest recorded price is from a prior date, the price field opens empty.

**MKT-013 — No additional backend call for pre-fill (frontend)**: The pre-fill data (MKT-011, MKT-012) is sourced from the `HoldingDetail` already loaded by the Account Details view. Opening the modal requires no additional IPC request.

### Recording a Price (020–029)

**MKT-020 — Required fields (frontend)**: The price form requires a non-empty date and a non-empty price. The submit button is disabled while either field is empty. The asset is implicit from the entry point and is not modifiable by the user.

**MKT-021 — Price validation (frontend + backend)**: A valid price is strictly greater than zero. The backend rejects a submitted price of zero or below with a specific error. The frontend validates inline and disables the submit button until corrected.

**MKT-022 — Date validation (frontend + backend)**: A valid date is a well-formed ISO 8601 calendar date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) that is not in the future. Any past date is accepted; no lower bound applies (users may backdate historical prices). The backend rejects an invalid or future date with a specific error. The frontend validates inline and disables the submit button until corrected.

**MKT-023 — Price currency (frontend + backend)**: The price is stored in the asset's native currency. No currency conversion is applied at recording time. The asset's currency code is displayed as a read-only label next to the price input field so the user knows which currency they are entering.

**MKT-024 — i64 storage (backend)**: The price is stored as i64 micro-units per ADR-001. The frontend transmits the human-readable decimal; the backend converts to micros at the IPC boundary.

**MKT-025 — Upsert by (asset, date) (backend)**: If a price record already exists for the same `(asset_id, date)` pair, it is overwritten with the new value. Otherwise a new record is created. This is transparent to the user; the form behaves identically for new and existing entries.

**MKT-026 — AssetPriceUpdated event (backend)**: After a successful upsert, the backend publishes an `AssetPriceUpdated` event on the event bus. This event carries no payload; it is a bare signal consistent with `AssetUpdated`, `CategoryUpdated`, `AccountUpdated`, and `TransactionUpdated`. It is published by the `asset` bounded context per B4. The Tauri frontend event discriminant string is `"AssetPriceUpdated"` — the variant name is forwarded as-is by the event forwarder, matching the convention for all existing events.

**MKT-027 — In-flight state (frontend)**: While the upsert request is in progress, the submit button is disabled and displays a spinner to prevent double-submission.

**MKT-028 — Success feedback (frontend)**: On success, the modal closes and a snackbar confirms the price was recorded.

**MKT-029 — Error feedback (frontend)**: On validation failure or backend rejection, the modal remains open. An inline error message is shown adjacent to the invalid field. The user can correct and resubmit without reopening the form.

### Display in Account Details (030–039)

**MKT-030 — Current price column (frontend + backend)**: The Account Details active holdings table gains a "Current Price" column. For each holding row, it displays `HoldingDetail.current_price` formatted in the asset's native currency. When `current_price_date` is available, it is shown as a secondary label (e.g. "as of 2026-04-25") to indicate the age of the data.

**MKT-031 — Latest price resolution (backend)**: The `AccountDetailsUseCase` retrieves the most recently dated `AssetPrice` for each active holding's asset via `AssetService`, per ADR-004 (use cases inject services, not repositories). If no record exists for an asset, `current_price` and `current_price_date` are `None`. A failure in the price lookup does not abort the overall `get_account_details` response; it degrades gracefully by returning `None` for the affected holding's price fields.

**MKT-032 — No-price placeholder (frontend)**: When `current_price` is `None` for a holding, the "Current Price", "Unrealized P&L", and "Performance %" columns display "—" for that row.

**MKT-033 — Unrealized P&L — same currency (backend)**: When the asset's native currency equals the account's currency (the gate condition defined in MKT-034), the backend computes `unrealized_pnl = (current_price − average_price) × quantity` using i128 intermediates before scaling back to i64, consistent with ACD-024. Both `current_price` and `average_price` are expressed in the same currency under this condition, making the subtraction valid. The result is included in `HoldingDetail.unrealized_pnl`. A zero result is returned as `0`, not `None`.

**MKT-034 — Unrealized P&L — currency mismatch (frontend + backend)**: When the asset currency differs from the account currency, `HoldingDetail.unrealized_pnl` and `HoldingDetail.performance_pct` are `None`. The frontend displays "—" in those columns. No exchange-rate conversion is attempted in this phase; multi-currency unrealized P&L is deferred to a future iteration.

**MKT-035 — Performance % (backend)**: When `unrealized_pnl` is available and `cost_basis` is non-zero, the backend computes `performance_pct = unrealized_pnl × 100 / cost_basis` as i64 micros using i128 intermediates and Rust integer division (truncation toward zero). Example: 5.25 % = 5 250 000 micros; −3.7 % = −3 700 000 micros. A zero result is returned as `0`, not `None`. When `cost_basis` is zero, `performance_pct` is `None`.

**MKT-036 — Reactivity (frontend)**: The Account Details event subscription adds `AssetPriceUpdated` alongside the existing `TransactionUpdated` and `AssetUpdated` subscriptions (ACD-039). Upon receiving `AssetPriceUpdated`, the view re-fetches account details, ensuring that newly recorded prices and all derived values (unrealized P&L, performance %, totals) are reflected immediately without a manual page refresh.

**MKT-037 — AssetPriceUpdated event registration (backend + frontend)**: The `AssetPriceUpdated` event is added to the event bus enum alongside `AssetUpdated`, `CategoryUpdated`, `AccountUpdated`, and `TransactionUpdated`. It is published exclusively by the `asset` bounded context. The global store treats it as a locally-handled event (no global data re-fetch triggered). `ARCHITECTURE.md` must be updated to register `AssetPriceUpdated` in the event bus table and to document that `useAccountDetails` subscribes to it alongside `TransactionUpdated` and `AssetUpdated`.

### Account Summary (040–049)

**MKT-040 — Total unrealized P&L (backend)**: `AccountDetailsResponse.total_unrealized_pnl` is the sum of `unrealized_pnl` across all active holdings for which the value is computable (same-currency holdings with a recorded price). Holdings with a currency mismatch or no recorded price are excluded from the sum and contribute nothing. When no holding qualifies, the field is `None`.

**MKT-041 — Total unrealized P&L display (frontend)**: The Account Details summary row displays `total_unrealized_pnl`. When the value is `None`, the summary shows "—". When the value is a number (including zero), it is displayed as-is; per-row "—" placeholders already communicate which individual holdings were excluded from the sum.

**MKT-042 — Correction by re-recording (backend)**: An `AssetPrice` record can be corrected by re-recording a price for the same `(asset_id, date)`, which overwrites the existing entry (MKT-025). Standalone edit (MKT-083, MKT-084) and delete (MKT-090) via the price history view are also supported.

**MKT-043 — Unknown asset rejection (backend)**: The backend rejects `record_asset_price` with a specific error if `asset_id` does not refer to a known asset. In normal use the asset is always selected from active holdings, making this case unreachable from the UI; the guard exists for API-level correctness.

### Auto-record from Transactions (050–069)

This section extends the buy/sell transaction flow defined in `docs/spec/financial-asset-transaction.md` (TRX) and `docs/spec/sell-transaction.md` (SEL). When the user opts in, recording a buy or sell transaction also writes an `AssetPrice` record so the transacted unit price becomes the asset's market price for the transaction date. Standalone edit and delete of `AssetPrice` records are now supported via the price history view (MKT-070+).

**MKT-050 — Global auto-record toggle (frontend)**: The Settings page exposes a toggle "Automatically record transaction price as market price". The toggle defaults to OFF. The user's choice persists across sessions on the current device. The toggle controls only the default state of the per-transaction checkbox (MKT-052); it never bypasses or replaces that checkbox.

**MKT-051 — Per-transaction checkbox (frontend)**: The buy and sell transaction forms (both creation forms — modal and the standalone /transactions/new page — and their edit variants) display a checkbox "Use this price as the market price for {transaction date}" placed immediately before the form's primary submit action, after all data fields. The label's date placeholder reflects the form's current `date` field value and updates live when the user changes it.

**MKT-052 — Checkbox default state (frontend)**: When the form opens to **create** a new transaction, the checkbox initial state equals the current value of the global toggle (MKT-050). When the form opens to **edit** an existing transaction, the checkbox initial state is always OFF, regardless of the global toggle.

**MKT-053 — Checkbox snapshot semantics (frontend)**: The checkbox initial state (MKT-052) is read from the global toggle once at form open. Subsequent changes to the global toggle do not propagate into already-open forms; the user keeps whatever state they have already set in the open form.

**MKT-054 — Submit payload (frontend + backend)**: The frontend forwards the checkbox state as a `record_price: bool` field added to the existing `CreateTransactionDTO` already used by `add_transaction` and `update_transaction` (per the project's Specta single-DTO convention). The backend never reads the global toggle directly — the per-call flag carried in the DTO is the only signal that determines whether a price is recorded.

**MKT-055 — Auto-write inside the orchestrator's DB transaction (backend)**: When `record_price` is `true` and `tx.unit_price > 0` (see MKT-061 for the zero-price exception), the `record_transaction` orchestrator writes an `AssetPrice` row directly inside the same DB transaction it has already opened for the transaction insert/update and the holding recomputation. The write targets `(asset_id = tx.asset_id, date = tx.date, price = tx.unit_price)` and uses the same upsert semantics as MKT-025 (insert on absence, replace on `(asset_id, date)` collision). The price is taken in the asset's native currency; `tx.unit_price` already excludes fees per the TRX domain definition, so no fee adjustment is applied. Validation rules MKT-021 (price > 0) and MKT-022 (date not in future) hold by construction here: TRX-020 enforces `tx.date` not in the future, and the `tx.unit_price > 0` precondition is enforced by MKT-061.

**MKT-056 — Atomicity (backend)**: The transaction insert/update, the holding recomputation (TRX-027 / SEL-025), and the auto-record `AssetPrice` upsert all commit in a single database transaction. If any step fails, the entire operation is rolled back; no partial state is persisted. This matches the pre-existing TRX-027 atomicity guarantee, extended to include the price write when `record_price = true`.

**MKT-057 — AssetPriceUpdated event on auto-record (backend)**: After the orchestrator's DB transaction commits successfully and `record_price` was `true` and a price was actually written (i.e. MKT-061 did not skip), the orchestrator invokes `AssetService::notify_asset_price_updated()` (consistent with B12 and the pattern of `AccountService::notify_transaction_updated()`) to publish the `AssetPriceUpdated` event defined in MKT-026. This is in addition to the `TransactionUpdated` event published by the transaction context. The two events are independent signals; their relative publication order is unspecified and is irrelevant to consumers because each subscriber refetches idempotently. When `record_price` is `false` or MKT-061 skipped the write, no `AssetPriceUpdated` event is published; behaviour is identical to the pre-feature add/update transaction flow.

**MKT-058 — Conflict — silent overwrite (backend)**: If an `AssetPrice` record already exists at `(tx.asset_id, tx.date)` when `record_price` is `true`, it is silently overwritten with `tx.unit_price` via the same upsert semantics as MKT-025. No prompt or warning is shown to the user; the form behaves identically whether or not a same-day price already exists.

**MKT-059 — Edit lifecycle — price independence (backend)**: Editing a transaction does not modify or remove any `AssetPrice` record previously written by that transaction. When the user re-saves an edited transaction with `record_price = true`, the upsert (MKT-055) targets the transaction's _current_ `tx.date` and _current_ `tx.unit_price`. If the user changed the transaction date during the edit, the price record at the prior date is left untouched and remains in storage; the upsert lands at the new date as a separate `(asset_id, date)` row. The same applies if the user changed the unit price: only the row at the current date is overwritten.

**MKT-060 — Delete lifecycle — price independence (backend)**: Deleting a transaction does not remove any `AssetPrice` record previously written by that transaction. `AssetPrice` records are independent of the transaction lifecycle: once persisted, they are governed solely by MKT rules (upsert via MKT-025; standalone delete via MKT-090).

**MKT-061 — Zero unit_price skip (backend)**: If `record_price` is `true` and `tx.unit_price` is `0` (a valid transaction per TRX-020 / SEL-020 — gifted or inherited assets), the orchestrator silently skips the `AssetPrice` write. The transaction itself proceeds normally and commits per its own validation rules; no `AssetPriceUpdated` event is published; no error is surfaced to the user. Rationale: a zero market price would conflict with MKT-021 (price > 0) and is not a meaningful signal of the asset's market value.

**MKT-062 — Auto-record failure surfaces as transaction error (backend + frontend)**: A persistence failure of the auto-record `AssetPrice` write triggers rollback of the entire orchestrator DB transaction (per MKT-056). The error is returned to the frontend through the existing `add_transaction` / `update_transaction` error contract (the same `RecordTransactionError` channel used for other backend errors in the form). The frontend displays it inline using the existing transaction-form error states from the TRX / SEL specs; no new dedicated error path or UI element is introduced. The user can correct the input or untick the auto-record checkbox and retry.

### Price History CRUD (070–092)

**MKT-070 — Price history entry point (frontend)**: A "Price history" action is available on each active holding row in Account Details, alongside the existing Buy, Sell, and "Enter price" actions. It is not shown on closed holdings.

**MKT-071 — Price history list contents (frontend)**: The price history view lists all `AssetPrice` records for the selected asset, sorted by date descending (most recent first). Each row displays the date and the price formatted in the asset's native currency. Edit and Delete affordances are shown on each row. `AssetPrice` is per asset (not per holding), so the history shows all recorded prices regardless of which account the entry point was reached from.

**MKT-072 — Backend query for price history (backend)**: The `asset` bounded context exposes a `get_asset_prices(asset_id)` command that returns all `AssetPrice` records for a given `asset_id`, ordered by date descending. The returned list includes all historical entries, not only the most recent. The command returns a specific error if `asset_id` does not refer to a known asset; a successful response with an empty list is returned when the asset exists but has no recorded prices.

**MKT-073 — Empty state (frontend)**: When no `AssetPrice` records exist for the asset, the price history view displays a message indicating no prices have been recorded yet, and offers an affordance to add the first price.

**MKT-074 — Loading and error states (frontend)**: While price records are being fetched, the price history view displays a loading indicator. A fetch failure surfaces an inline error with a retry affordance; the view remains open rather than closing.

**MKT-075 — In-view "Add price" affordance (frontend)**: The price history view includes an action to add a new price entry, opening the same recording form governed by MKT-020–MKT-029 (same validation, same upsert semantics, same `AssetPriceUpdated` publication). After a successful add, the history list refreshes to include the new entry.

**MKT-076 — View reactivity after mutations (frontend)**: After a successful add (MKT-075), edit (MKT-086), or delete (MKT-092), the price history view re-fetches its list via MKT-072. The `AssetPriceUpdated` event emitted by the backend (MKT-026, MKT-085, MKT-091) independently causes the Account Details view to re-fetch, keeping the current-price column and derived values in sync without any additional coordination by the price history view.

**MKT-080 — Edit action (frontend)**: Each row in the price history list has an Edit action that opens an edit form pre-filled with that row's date and price.

**MKT-081 — Edit form fields (frontend)**: The edit form displays the asset name as a read-only label, an editable date field, and an editable price field, both pre-filled with the current values of the selected entry. The asset's currency code is shown as a read-only label next to the price field, consistent with MKT-023.

**MKT-082 — Edit validation (frontend + backend)**: The edit form applies the same validation as price recording: price must be strictly greater than zero (MKT-021) and date must be a well-formed ISO 8601 calendar date not in the future (MKT-022). The backend rejects invalid values with the same specific errors. The frontend validates inline and disables the submit button until all fields are valid.

**MKT-083 — Edit semantics — same date (backend)**: The `asset` bounded context exposes an `update_asset_price(asset_id, original_date, new_date, new_price)` command that returns `()` on success. When `original_date` equals `new_date`, the backend updates the price in place at the existing `(asset_id, date)` row; a single-row in-place update is inherently atomic. The command returns `NotFound` if the record at `(asset_id, original_date)` does not exist, or `Unknown` for any other failure.

**MKT-084 — Edit semantics — date changed (backend)**: When `original_date` differs from `new_date` in an `update_asset_price` call (MKT-083), the backend deletes the record at `(asset_id, original_date)` and upserts a new record at `(asset_id, new_date)`. If a record already exists at the new date, it is silently overwritten, consistent with MKT-025. The deletion and the upsert are atomic within a single database transaction; a failure in either step rolls back the entire operation.

**MKT-085 — AssetPriceUpdated after successful edit (backend)**: After a successful edit (MKT-083 or MKT-084), the backend publishes an `AssetPriceUpdated` event consistent with MKT-026. No event is published if the edit fails.

**MKT-086 — Edit success feedback (frontend)**: On a successful edit, the edit form closes, the price history list refreshes (MKT-076), and a snackbar confirms the price was updated.

**MKT-087 — Edit error feedback (frontend)**: On a validation failure or backend rejection, the edit form remains open. An inline error message is shown adjacent to the invalid field. The user can correct and resubmit without reopening the form.

**MKT-094 — Edit in-flight state (frontend)**: While the edit submit request is in progress, the submit button is disabled and displays a spinner to prevent double-submission, consistent with MKT-027.

**MKT-095 — asset_id is immutable on edit (backend)**: The `update_asset_price` command (MKT-083) does not accept a new `asset_id`. The asset an `AssetPrice` belongs to cannot be changed after creation; only the date and price are modifiable.

**MKT-088 — Delete action (frontend)**: Each row in the price history list has a Delete action.

**MKT-089 — Delete confirmation dialog (frontend)**: Triggering the Delete action opens a confirmation dialog that identifies the date and price of the record to be removed. The user must explicitly confirm before deletion proceeds.

**MKT-090 — Delete command (backend)**: The `asset` bounded context exposes a `delete_asset_price(asset_id, date)` command that returns `()` on success. If no record exists at `(asset_id, date)`, the command returns `NotFound`. Any other failure returns `Unknown`.

**MKT-091 — AssetPriceUpdated after deletion (backend)**: After a successful deletion, the backend publishes an `AssetPriceUpdated` event consistent with MKT-026. The Account Details view re-fetches via MKT-036; if the deleted entry was the most recently dated price for the asset, the holding row falls back to the next most recent price or shows "—" if no records remain.

**MKT-092 — Delete success feedback (frontend)**: On a successful deletion, the price history list refreshes (MKT-076) and a snackbar confirms the price record was removed.

**MKT-093 — In-flight state for delete (frontend)**: While the delete request is in progress (after the user confirms in MKT-089), the Delete action for the targeted row is disabled to prevent double-submission.

**MKT-096 — Delete error feedback (frontend)**: If the delete request fails, an error banner is shown at the top of the price history list. The view remains open and the targeted entry is not removed from the list. The user may retry.

## Workflow

```
Account Details (active holding row)
    → "Enter price" button
    → PriceModal opens (no extra fetch — uses HoldingDetail data)
        date = today (editable)
        price = current_price if current_price_date == today, else empty
        → user enters price, adjusts date if needed
        → submit
            backend: validate price > 0 and date ≤ today
            backend: upsert AssetPrice(asset_id, date, price)
            backend: publish AssetPriceUpdated (bare signal)
        → modal closes + snackbar
        → Account Details re-fetches on AssetPriceUpdated
        → holding row: current price, unrealized P&L, performance % updated
```

### Workflow — Price history CRUD (MKT-070+)

```
Account Details (active holding row)
    → "Price history" button (MKT-070)
    → PriceHistoryView opens; list fetched via MKT-072
        → sorted date descending; Edit + Delete per row
        → "Add price" action → same flow as "Enter price" (MKT-020–029)

Edit row:
    → Edit form opens pre-filled with (date, price)
    → user changes date and/or price
    → submit
        same date → in-place update (MKT-083)
        new date  → delete old + upsert at new date (MKT-084)
        on failure → rollback, form stays open (MKT-087)
    → success: form closes + snackbar + list refreshes + AssetPriceUpdated (MKT-085, MKT-086)
    → Account Details re-fetches on AssetPriceUpdated (MKT-076)

Delete row:
    → confirmation dialog identifies (date, price) (MKT-089)
    → user confirms
        backend: delete_asset_price(asset_id, date) (MKT-090)
        backend: publish AssetPriceUpdated (MKT-091)
    → list refreshes; Account Details re-fetches (MKT-076)
    → if deleted entry was most recent price: holding row shows "—" or next price
```

### Workflow — Auto-record from a buy/sell transaction (MKT-050+)

```
Settings page
    → "Automatically record transaction price as market price" toggle
    → choice persisted to localStorage (default OFF)

Buy/Sell transaction form (create or edit)
    → checkbox "Use this price as the market price for {date}"
        create mode → default = global toggle snapshot at open (MKT-052)
        edit mode   → default = OFF (MKT-052)
    → user submits
        frontend: record_price: bool added to CreateTransactionDTO (MKT-054)
        backend orchestrator (single DB transaction, MKT-056):
            ├─ insert/update Transaction
            ├─ recompute Holding (TRX-027 / SEL-025)
            └─ if record_price && tx.unit_price > 0:                       (MKT-061 skip-on-zero)
                 upsert AssetPrice(tx.asset_id, tx.date, tx.unit_price)    (MKT-055, MKT-058)
        → commit; on any failure rollback the whole DB transaction        (MKT-056, MKT-062)
        → after commit:
            transaction context publishes TransactionUpdated              (B8)
            if a price was actually written:
                asset context publishes AssetPriceUpdated                 (MKT-057, B8)
        → Account Details re-fetches via AssetPriceUpdated                 (MKT-036)
```

## UX Draft

### Entry Point

"Enter price" icon button on each active holding row in Account Details, in the actions column alongside Buy and Sell. Not shown on closed holdings.

### Main Component

Small modal dialog. No navigation — stays within Account Details.

### Form Fields

| Field          | Default                                   | Editable |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Asset name     | Pre-filled from holding row               | No       |
| Date           | Today                                     | Yes      |
| Price          | Today's existing price if any, else empty | Yes      |
| Currency label | Asset's native currency code              | No       |

### States

- **Submit in-flight** (MKT-027): Submit button disabled + spinner while persisting.
- **Validation / backend error** (MKT-029): Inline error adjacent to the invalid field; modal stays open.
- **Success** (MKT-028): Modal closes; snackbar "Price recorded."
- **No price (holding row)**: "—" in Current Price, Unrealized P&L, Performance % columns.
- **Currency mismatch (holding row)**: Current Price shown in asset currency; Unrealized P&L and Performance % show "—".

### User Flow

1. User views Account Details for an account.
2. User clicks "Enter price" on a holding row.
3. Modal opens immediately (no fetch) with asset name, today's date, and price pre-filled if a same-day entry exists.
4. User types the current market price (in asset currency, shown as a label).
5. User optionally changes the date (e.g. to use yesterday's closing price).
6. User submits.
7. Backend validates, upserts the price, publishes `AssetPriceUpdated`.
8. Modal closes, snackbar confirms.
9. Account Details re-fetches: the holding row now shows current price, unrealized P&L, performance %.

### UX Draft — Auto-record from Transactions (MKT-050+)

#### Settings page

A new toggle row "Automatically record transaction price as market price" sits alongside the existing language preference. Default OFF. State persists across sessions on the current device.

#### Buy and sell transaction forms

A checkbox is added directly above the submit button in:

- the buy creation modal,
- the sell creation modal,
- the standalone /transactions/new form (whether the transaction is a buy or a sell),
- the edit variants of all the above.

| Field             | Default                                                 | Editable |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Auto-record price | Snapshot of global toggle on create; always OFF on edit | Yes      |

The label updates live with the form's date field: "Use this price as the market price for 2026-04-27".

#### States

- **Checkbox unchecked**: no behaviour change; the form behaves exactly as before this feature.
- **Checkbox checked + submit success**: the standard transaction success path (snackbar, modal close, list refresh) is unchanged. The new `AssetPriceUpdated` event causes Account Details to refresh its market-price columns transparently.
- **Submit failure with checkbox checked**: the form remains open with the standard inline transaction error feedback (MKT-062). No price is written (atomicity, MKT-056). The user can untick the checkbox or correct the inputs and retry.
- **Same-day price already recorded**: no warning shown; the existing entry is silently overwritten on submit (MKT-058).
- **Zero `unit_price`**: when the buy/sell unit price is `0` (gifted asset, TRX-020), the auto-record step is silently skipped per MKT-061. The transaction itself succeeds normally; the checkbox state has no observable effect in this case.

#### User flow — global default

1. User opens Settings.
2. User flips "Automatically record transaction price as market price" ON.
3. User opens a buy form anywhere in the app — the auto-record checkbox is pre-checked.
4. User submits; the unit price is recorded as the day's market price in addition to the transaction.

#### User flow — per-transaction override

1. Global toggle is OFF (default).
2. User opens a sell form for an asset they want to also stamp a market price for today.
3. User ticks the auto-record checkbox manually before submitting.
4. User submits; the price is recorded for this transaction only. The next form opens with the box unchecked again.

### UX Draft — Price History CRUD (MKT-070+)

#### Entry Point

"Price history" icon button on each active holding row in Account Details, in the actions column alongside Buy, Sell, and "Enter price". Not shown on closed holdings.

#### Main Component

Modal or side panel listing all recorded `AssetPrice` entries for the selected asset (per asset, not per account).

#### States

- **Loading**: spinner while prices are fetched on open (MKT-074).
- **Empty**: "No prices recorded yet" message with an "Add price" button (MKT-073).
- **Populated**: date-descending list; each row shows date, price (in asset currency), Edit button, Delete button.
- **Edit form** (inline within modal, or nested modal): date + price fields, pre-filled; same inline error feedback as "Enter price" form (MKT-087).
- **In-flight (edit)**: Submit button disabled + spinner while the edit request is in progress (MKT-094).
- **Delete confirmation** (standard ConfirmationDialog): identifies date + price of the record to be removed (MKT-089).
- **In-flight (delete)**: Delete button for the targeted row is disabled while the request is in progress (MKT-093).
- **Delete error**: error banner at the top of the list; entry remains visible (MKT-096).
- **Fetch error**: inline error with retry (MKT-074).

#### User Flow — View and delete a stale price

1. User views Account Details and notices a price in the current-price column that looks wrong.
2. User clicks "Price history" on that holding row.
3. Modal opens; list is fetched and displayed date-descending.
4. User locates the stale entry, clicks Delete.
5. Confirmation dialog appears identifying the date and price.
6. User confirms.
7. Backend deletes the record, publishes `AssetPriceUpdated`.
8. History list refreshes; Account Details re-fetches — holding row now shows the next most recent price or "—".

#### User Flow — Correct a price with a wrong date

1. User opens "Price history" for a holding.
2. User finds an entry recorded on the wrong date (e.g. recorded on 2026-04-28 but should be 2026-04-27).
3. User clicks Edit on that row.
4. Edit form opens pre-filled with the wrong date and the price.
5. User changes the date to 2026-04-27.
6. User submits.
7. Backend deletes the 2026-04-28 record and upserts at 2026-04-27 (MKT-084).
8. Edit form closes; history list refreshes; snackbar confirms (MKT-086).

## Open Questions

- [x] **OQ-1** — Should the standalone "Enter price" action on the holding row (MKT-010) be removed? **Decision: keep both.** MKT-010 remains as a fast path for the common case (record today's price without opening history). MKT-070 adds a second "Price history" action for review and corrections. The holding row will have five actions: Buy, Sell, Enter price, Price history, and the transaction magnifier.

None — all questions have been resolved.
