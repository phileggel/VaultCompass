# Business Rules — Asset Management

## Context

An asset represents a financial instrument or resource owned by the user: stock, ETF, bond, real estate, cryptocurrency, etc. Each asset belongs to a user category (e.g. "European Stocks", "Real Estate") and carries an ISO 4217 currency which is the security's quotation currency. Asset management is the foundation of the rest of the application: an account (`Account`) groups assets via operations (`Operation`); the performance dashboard relies on assets to compute portfolio value.

This spec covers asset creation, modification, and archival, both backend and frontend. CRUD rules for `AssetCategory` are in `docs/category.md`. Asset prices (`AssetPrice`) are handled in `docs/operation.md`.

> Note: `reference` alone is not sufficient to uniquely identify an instrument at the pricing scale (the same ticker can exist on multiple exchanges with different currencies). The pricing deduplication key will be defined in a dedicated spec.

## Asset field definitions

### `name`

Human-readable name of the instrument (e.g. "Apple Inc.", "SCPI Pierval").

### `class`

Type of financial asset among the fixed values of `AssetClass` (see AST-003). Not user-customizable.

### `category`

Free-form grouping defined by the user (e.g. "US Stocks", "European Real Estate"). Used to aggregate values in the performance dashboard. It is not a fixed taxonomy: the user creates their own categories.

### `currency`

**Quotation** currency of the security (ISO 4217: USD, EUR, BTC…). It is the currency in which the asset price is expressed — distinct from the account's reference currency. E.g. an Apple stock quoted in USD in an account whose reference currency is EUR.

### `risk_level`

Subjective risk score from 1 (low risk) to 5 (high risk). The frontend suggests a default value based on the chosen `class` (see AST-003), editable manually.

### `reference`

Security identifier: stock ticker (e.g. `AAPL`), ISIN code (e.g. `FR0000131104`), or free-form identifier entered by the user (e.g. `APPART-PARIS-15`) for non-quoted assets. Required.

### `is_archived`

Indicates whether the asset is archived (removed from active lists). An archived asset retains all its historical data but cannot be modified or receive new prices.

## Business rules

### Asset — Backend

**AST-001 (was R1) — Field validation (backend)**: An asset is valid if and only if: `name` is non-empty, `reference` is non-empty, `category` is set, `class` is a value of `AssetClass`, `currency` is a valid ISO 4217 code, and `risk_level` is an integer between 1 and 5 inclusive. Any violation is rejected by the backend with an explicit error.

**AST-003 (was R3) — Asset classes and default risk (backend)**: Classification (`AssetClass`) is a fixed pre-seeded list, not user-customizable:

| Class          | `default_risk` |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| `Cash`         | 1              |
| `Bonds`        | 2              |
| `MutualFunds`  | 3              |
| `ETF`          | 3              |
| `Stocks`       | 4              |
| `RealEstate`   | 2              |
| `DigitalAsset` | 5              |

The default value is `Cash`.

**AST-004 (was R4) — Reference normalization (backend)**: The reference is normalized at receipt: leading and trailing whitespace stripped, converted to uppercase (internal whitespace preserved).

**AST-005 (was R5) — Asset update (backend)**: All asset fields are editable after creation. The validation rules (AST-001) and reference normalization (AST-004) apply to modification as well as creation.

**AST-006 (was R6) — Asset archival (backend)**: Archiving an asset sets `is_archived = true`. The asset disappears from active lists but all associated data is preserved (operations, prices, holdings). An archived asset can no longer receive new prices or be modified.

**AST-018 (was R18) — Asset unarchival (backend)**: Unarchiving an asset sets `is_archived = false`. The asset becomes active again, reappears in active lists, and can again be modified and receive new prices.

### Asset — Frontend

**AST-002 (was R2) — Category pre-selection (frontend)**: The form pre-selects `default-uncategorized` if no category is chosen by the user, ensuring the field is always set on submission.

**AST-007 (was R7) — Asset table (frontend)**: The table displays the following columns, in this order, sorted by Name ascending by default:

| Column    | Content                                   | Sortable |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Name      | `asset.name`                              | Yes      |
| Reference | `asset.reference`                         | Yes      |
| Class     | `asset.class`                             | Yes      |
| Category  | `asset.category.name`                     | Yes      |
| CCY       | `asset.currency`                          | Yes      |
| Risk      | `asset.risk_level` — risk badge (AST-011) | Yes      |
| Status    | "Archived" badge if `is_archived = true`  | No       |
| Actions   | See AST-013, AST-019, AST-020             | No       |

The table displays only active assets (`is_archived = false`) by default. A page header shows the title "Assets" and the total active asset count.

**AST-016 (was R16) — Fuzzy search (frontend)**: A search field in the header filters the list in real time on name, reference, class, and category. The search applies only to assets currently displayed: active assets only if the AST-019 toggle is off, both active and archived if the toggle is on. If no result matches, the table displays "No results for this search."

**AST-017 (was R17) — Column sorting (frontend)**: Clicking a sortable column header sorts the list by that column ascending. A second click toggles to descending.

**AST-008 (was R8) — Creation via FAB (frontend)**: A floating FAB at the bottom right opens a creation modal. The form contains: Name (required), Reference (required), ISO Currency (required), Category (select, pre-selected to `default-uncategorized`, see AST-002), Class (select, pre-selected to `Cash`), Risk level (1–5 selector, pre-filled per class, see AST-010). Submission is blocked if name, reference, or currency is missing.

**AST-009 (was R9) — Reference duplicate warning (frontend)**: When creating or modifying an asset, if the entered reference matches (case-insensitive) the reference of an existing asset — active or archived — regardless of class, a non-blocking warning is shown in the form. The user can ignore the warning and confirm. The warning is intentionally non-blocking: the same identifier may legitimately designate distinct instruments depending on quotation currency or marketplace. Archived assets are included in the check to avoid silent duplicates in case of later unarchival.

**AST-010 (was R10) — Risk level suggestion at creation (frontend)**: At creation only, when the user selects a class, the `risk_level` field is automatically pre-filled with the `default_risk` of that class (AST-003), then editable manually.

**AST-011 (was R11) — Risk badge in the table (frontend)**: The risk level is displayed in the table as a colored badge, one color per level: light green (1), green (2), orange (3), light red (4), red (5).

**AST-012 (was R12) — Asset modification (frontend)**: The Edit button opens a modal showing the same form as creation, pre-filled with the current asset values. The same validation rules apply (AST-008): submission is blocked if a required field is missing. The existing `risk_level` is shown as-is and is never automatically replaced when the class changes — the automatic suggestion (AST-010) does not apply in edit mode. After save, the modal closes and the table refreshes.

**AST-013 (was R13) — Asset archival (frontend)**: The Archive button opens a confirmation dialog stating that the asset will be removed from active lists and will no longer receive new prices, but that all historical data is preserved. Confirmation triggers archival (AST-006).

**AST-014 (was R14) — Backend errors (frontend)**: The modal stays open during the backend call and only closes on success. Any failure displays an inline error message in the active modal or dialog.

**AST-015 (was R15) — Load error state (frontend)**: If the initial list load fails, the table displays an error message with a Retry button.

**AST-019 (was R19) — Archived assets toggle (frontend)**: The header exposes a "Show archived" toggle. When on, archived assets appear in the table with a dimmed visual style on the entire row (not only the badge), making it immediately clear which assets are active vs archived. The Archive button is replaced by an Unarchive button on archived rows; the Edit button is disabled.

**AST-020 (was R20) — Unarchive from the table (frontend)**: The Unarchive button (visible only on archived rows when the AST-019 toggle is on) opens a confirmation dialog. Confirmation triggers unarchival (AST-018) and the asset reappears in the active list.

## UX Mockup

### Entry point

**Assets** — item in the main navigation drawer.

### Main component

Full-width table page, sorted by Name ascending by default. Floating FAB at the bottom right. Edit (primary icon) and Archive (archive icon) buttons on each row.

### States

- **Empty**: "No assets. Create your first asset with the + button."
- **Loading**: Loading indicator in the table
- **Load error**: Error message + Retry button (AST-015)
- **Duplicate warning**: Inline banner in the form, non-blocking (AST-009)
- **Archive confirmation**: Dialog explaining that the asset will be removed from active lists and that historical data is preserved (AST-013)
- **Archived assets visible**: Visually distinct rows, Unarchive button instead of Archive, Edit button disabled (AST-019)
- **Unarchive confirmation**: Confirmation dialog before reactivation (AST-020)
- **Backend error**: Inline error message in the active modal or dialog (AST-014)

### User flow — asset creation

1. The user clicks the FAB → creation modal opens.
2. They select a class → `risk_level` automatically pre-filled (AST-010).
3. They fill in the other fields. If the reference already exists → non-blocking warning (AST-009).
4. They submit → asset created → modal closed → table refreshed.

### User flow — asset archival

1. The user clicks Archive → dialog explaining the asset will be removed from active lists and that data is preserved.
2. They confirm → archival (AST-006).

## Future features

### Hard-delete an asset

Allow physical deletion (hard delete) of an archived asset, only if no operation references it. If operations exist, hard delete is blocked — archival remains the only option. This feature is not in scope for the current implementation.

### Asset operations history

Display, from the Assets page, the list of operations linked to a given asset. Likely entry point: a contextual action on the asset row in the table, opening a panel or dedicated sub-page. This feature will be handled in the `operation` spec.

### Success feedback via snackbar

Display a snackbar notification after mutation operations (creation, modification, archival, unarchival), replacing the simple "modal closed" visual feedback. Requires a snackbar component in the design system first.
