## (asset) — Asset-price commands do not surface `Archived` per AST-006

AST-006 states "An archived asset can no longer receive new prices." But `record_asset_price`, `update_asset_price`, and `delete_asset_price` in `docs/contracts/asset-contract.md` list only `NotFound` / `PriceNotFound` / `DatabaseError` — no `Archived` variant. The BE likely does not enforce the archived guard for these commands today (predates the MKT auto-fetch amendment).

**Two paths**:

- **If AST-006 intent is enforced**: add archive guards in `AssetService::record_asset_price` / `update_asset_price` / `delete_asset_price`, surface `Archived` variant in the contract for all three, add covering tests. Code change.
- **If AST-006 intent is "price ops are independent of archive state"** (matching current behaviour): amend AST-006 in `docs/spec/asset.md` to carve out price recording, no contract change.

Surfaced 2026-05-17 by `contract-reviewer` after the MKT auto-fetch amendment. Out of scope for that amendment but worth resolving before the next asset-domain feature.

## (contracts) — Migrate account-contract.md and update-contract.md to wire-only framing

`asset-contract.md` was migrated 2026-05-17 to the wire-only framing — no Rust-internal type names (composites, leaves, `*ApplicationError` / `*DomainError`) in the contract; each command's "Errors" column lists wire-flat variant codes only. The other two contracts still use the older "Error type | Reachable codes" two-column shape with Rust-internal attributions.

**Scope per file**:

- `docs/contracts/account-contract.md` — ~15 commands across Account CRUD + Holding/Transaction + Cash; header rework + per-command table cleanup
- `docs/contracts/update-contract.md` — ~3 commands; small file

**Approach** (per file): replace the multi-block error-model header (composites + leaves) with a short wire-only intro mirroring `asset-contract.md`; for each command row, collapse "Error type | Reachable codes" into a single "Errors" column listing variant codes (strip `(AssetApplicationError, ...)` / `(*DomainError)` attributions, keep spec-rule tags like `(MKT-043)` and contextual prose like `(when category_id missing)`). Also drop the `## Changelog` section — git history is the changelog.

**Estimate**: ~1.5h for both files combined (mechanical doc editing).

**Trigger**: bundle with the next session that touches either BC, or run as a standalone refactor PR.

Surfaced 2026-05-17 during `/contract market-price`.

## (mkt) — Surface fetch-task completion to FE for end-of-task user feedback

`fetch_all_asset_prices` and `fetch_account_asset_prices` return synchronously on dispatch; per-asset results stream via `AssetPriceUpdated` events. The user has no signal for "task finished" — whether successfully, with partial failures, or with full provider outage. Per-asset failures are currently logged BE-side per MKT-114 with no FE surface; the task-level summary is the missing layer.

**Proposed**: emit a task-completion signal (e.g. `FetchTaskCompleted { scope, ok: u32, skipped: u32 }`) and an FE snackbar/banner that summarizes — "12 prices updated, 3 skipped". Distinct from `AssetPriceUpdated` (which is per-asset) and complements MKT-115 (which currently only covers dispatch-time feedback).

Surfaced 2026-05-17 during `/contract market-price` triage. Spec amendment to MKT-114 (or a new MKT-117+) will be needed.

## (spec) — Write KEY spec (User API Key Management)

ADR-011 captures the BYOK + OS keychain + 3-tier fallback decision. The spec to write — trigram `KEY` — covers the Tauri command surface, state machine, Connections settings panel UX, link-out to provider signup, "test connection" probe, and the Linux-without-keyring detection + UX flow.

Cross-cutting enabler: every current and future external-provider feature depends on this. Once shipped, the OpenFIGI 429 TODO above is largely subsumed (the user just adds a key).

Workflow-A: `/spec-writer api-key-management` → `/contract` → `feature-planner` → implementation. ~1-2 day feature.

Surfaced 2026-05-16 during the asset-valuation ADR thread.

## (spec) — Write FXR spec (Foreign Exchange Rate)

ADR-009 introduces a new `CurrencyRate` entity, but no spec defines its bounded context, repository contract, or read path. Trigram `FXR`. Covers the entity definition, EUR-base + cross-rate computation algorithm, source qualifier (per ADR-010), Frankfurter primary + ECB XML fallback flow, manual entry CRUD, and the cache/refresh policy that parallels MKT's.

Prerequisite for PFD (cross-currency rollup needs current FX).

Workflow-A: `/spec-writer fx-rate` → `/contract` → `feature-planner` → implementation.

Surfaced 2026-05-16 by `adr-reviewer` after ADR-009 was written.

## (asset) — Promote ISIN to canonical identifier alongside ticker

`Asset.reference` is currently a single field that ends up holding either an ISIN or a ticker depending on how the asset was created (ISIN search → ISIN; keyword search → ticker; manual → whatever the user typed). This makes the AST uniqueness check semantic noise — the same instrument can be created twice as `AI` and `FR0000120073` and the two records won't dedup.

Industry convention: ISIN is the canonical identity (stable across rebrands, globally unique by ISO 6166), ticker is a venue-specific display label that can change (e.g. `TOT → TTE` for Total → TotalEnergies in 2021).

**Proposed shape (additive, no breaking migration):**

- New nullable column `isin: Option<String>` on `Asset`
- Existing `reference` field becomes the human-friendly ticker (rename to `ticker` if breaking is acceptable; otherwise leave as-is and treat the field as ticker)
- Uniqueness check switches to ISIN-when-present, ticker-when-not
- Add Asset form: ticker required, ISIN optional
- Web lookup ISIN-path → both filled; keyword-path → ticker only (OpenFIGI's free `/v3/mapping` response doesn't expose ISIN, so we cannot recover it for keyword-discovered assets)
- Manual creation: ticker required, ISIN optional with a "lookup ISIN" affordance for the user

**Why it's not done now:** the just-shipped WEB-050 fix already surfaces the right primary listing for free-text searches; the user pain that motivated this discussion is resolved. Adding a second identifier field is a 1–2 day Workflow-A feature (migration, domain entity, validation, AST spec edit, gateway, presenter, form, tests) and only pays off once a downstream feature actually consumes ISIN.

**Spawning point:** wire it in as part of the first downstream ISIN consumer (dividend tracking, broker import/export, corporate-action handling). At that point the cost is amortized into the feature that needs it. Surfaced during the WEB-050 review (2026-05-08).

## (spec) — PFD (Portfolio Dashboard) unblocked, no spec written

`docs/spec-index.md` lists PFD as `planning — paused — blocked on cash-tracking spec`. Cash-tracking shipped on 2026-05-06, so the blocker is lifted, but no `docs/spec/portfolio-dashboard.md` has been written yet. Next step when picked up: run `/spec-writer portfolio-dashboard` to author the cross-account aggregate-view spec (KPIs + per-account list, per the registry description), then the standard `/contract` → `feature-planner` flow. Update `docs/spec-index.md` to drop the "paused — blocked on cash-tracking spec" suffix at the same time.

## (backend) — `correct_transaction` / `cancel_transaction` parameter style

`correct_transaction(id: String, account_id: String, dto: CorrectTransactionDTO)` and `cancel_transaction(id: String, account_id: String)` mix primitives + DTO; the rest of the holding-transaction commands are DTO-only. Move `id`/`account_id` into the DTOs for consistency. Frontend impact: gateway call sites change. Surfaced during cash-tracking spec review (2026-05-05); per-command-error-enums concern from the original entry is subsumed by `docs/plan/error-model-refactor.md` PR 3.

## (backend) — Promote BC application services to traits, mock with mockall

`AccountService` and `AssetService` are concrete structs, so cross-BC orchestrators (`HoldingTransactionUseCase`, `ArchiveAssetUseCase`, `DeleteAssetUseCase`, `AccountDetailsUseCase`, …) cannot mockall-mock them and instead test against real services + in-memory SQLite. That's against the spirit of `docs/backend-rules.md` B34 ("Tests for services and orchestrators SHOULD mock external dependencies using mockall-generated mocks") — repositories already follow B34 via `#[cfg_attr(test, mockall::automock)]` on each domain.rs trait, but the service layer above them does not.

Extract a trait per service (e.g. `AccountServiceContract`, `AssetServiceContract`) listing the methods orchestrators call, annotate with `#[cfg_attr(test, mockall::automock)]`, and have orchestrators inject `Arc<dyn AccountServiceContract>` / `Arc<dyn AssetServiceContract>`. Then rewrite the orchestrator inline tests to use the generated `MockAccountService` / `MockAssetService` instead of `setup_pool` + real repositories — true unit isolation, faster, no DB dependency. Surfaced during PR #4 review (2026-05-06).

## (backend) — Introduce dependency injection container for service wiring

`lib.rs` manually constructs and wires all repositories, services, and use cases in a single `block_on` closure. As the number of bounded contexts grows this becomes hard to maintain. Introduce a lightweight DI approach (e.g. a dedicated `AppContainer` struct or a builder pattern) to decouple service construction from app bootstrap, make the dependency graph explicit, and simplify testing of the wiring itself.

## (deps) — Upgrade reqwest to 0.13

`reqwest 0.12.28` is a major version behind (`0.13.3` available). Breaking changes: TLS default switches from native-tls to rustls+aws-lc; `query()`/`form()` are now optional features; several deprecated methods removed. Current feature flags (`rustls-tls-native-roots`, `json`) need review against the new defaults before upgrading. See `docs/dep-audit-2026-05-05.md`.

## (deps) — Update specta to rc.23

`tauri-specta rc.21` pins `specta = "=2.0.0-rc.22"` (exact version). Wait for `tauri-specta rc.22+` before upgrading to `specta rc.23` + `specta-typescript 0.0.10`.
Status (2026-04-27): `specta rc.23` available, `tauri-specta` still blocked at `rc.21`.

## (deps) — Accepted risk: RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (rsa Marvin Attack)

`cargo audit` flags `rsa 0.9.10` (timing sidechannel, CVSS 5.9 medium) with no upstream fix. Pulled transitively via `sqlx-mysql 0.8.6` because the `sqlx` macro crate compiles all backends regardless of enabled features. We only enable `sqlite`, so the vulnerable RSA path is never reached at runtime. Re-evaluate when sqlx ships a fix or when we change DB backend.

## (mkt) — Stooq cannot find FR001400U5Q4 (and likely other French OAT/bond ISINs)

User-reported 2026-05-24: a Stooq fetch for `FR001400U5Q4` returns no data. `FR0014…` is the ISIN range for French government bonds (OATs) issued via Agence France Trésor. Stooq's symbol coverage may not include FR OATs at all, or may require a different symbol prefix (`oat_…`, `…oats`, etc.). Investigate Stooq's symbol scheme for FR bonds; if unsupported, surface a clearer "provider does not cover this ISIN" message instead of generic "not found", and consider documenting the coverage gap in MKT spec.

## (fe) — Account details price column too dense + FR date in EN locale

User-reported 2026-05-24: the holdings table's price cell shows 4–5 lines (price + Stooq tag + date + update info). Reorganize the data into 2–3 columns so each cell is one line. Also a locale bug: dates render in FR format (`DD/MM/YYYY`) even when the UI locale is English — likely a `toLocaleDateString` call missing the locale argument or using a hardcoded one. Both issues live in the holdings view of the account details page.

## (fe) — Rename "Open balance" → clearer label

User-reported 2026-05-24: the "Open balance" CTA is opaque to users without a finance background and not great even with one. Rename to something self-explanatory like "Add a position" (i18n in both `common.json` namespaces). Probably affects holdings creation flow in account details + transactions UI.
