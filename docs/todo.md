## (backend) — Introduce dependency injection container for service wiring

`lib.rs` manually constructs and wires all repositories, services, and use cases in a single `block_on` closure. As the number of bounded contexts grows this becomes hard to maintain. Introduce a lightweight DI approach (e.g. a dedicated `AppContainer` struct or a builder pattern) to decouple service construction from app bootstrap, make the dependency graph explicit, and simplify testing of the wiring itself.

## (deps) — Update specta to rc.23

`tauri-specta rc.21` pins `specta = "=2.0.0-rc.22"` (exact version). Wait for `tauri-specta rc.22+` before upgrading to `specta rc.23` + `specta-typescript 0.0.10`.
Status (2026-04-27): `specta rc.23` available, `tauri-specta` still blocked at `rc.21`.

## (deps) — Accepted risk: RUSTSEC-2023-0071 (rsa Marvin Attack)

`cargo audit` flags `rsa 0.9.10` (timing sidechannel, CVSS 5.9 medium) with no upstream fix. Pulled transitively via `sqlx-mysql 0.8.6` because the `sqlx` macro crate compiles all backends regardless of enabled features. We only enable `sqlite`, so the vulnerable RSA path is never reached at runtime. Re-evaluate when sqlx ships a fix or when we change DB backend.
