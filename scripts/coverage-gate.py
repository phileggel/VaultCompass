"""Fail when line coverage of the code that carries logic drops under its floor.

Reads the lcov reports the test runners already produce and checks one number
per layer: the share of covered lines across the paths listed in
`coverage-gates.json`. Anything outside those paths (wire adapters, generated
bindings, tests) does not count either way.

    python3 scripts/coverage-gate.py              # both layers
    python3 scripts/coverage-gate.py --frontend   # one layer
    python3 scripts/coverage-gate.py --backend

Exit 1 when a layer is under its floor, or when its report is missing. The
floors are a ratchet: raise them in the same change that lifts coverage,
never lower them.
