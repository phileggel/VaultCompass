"""Auto-rebase + fast-forward merge the current feature branch into a target branch.

Atomic "task done" shortcut: pull the target, rebase the branch onto it,
FF-merge into the target, push, and delete the feature branch both locally
and on origin. Fails fast with a clear recovery hint at any step that can't
proceed cleanly (rebase conflict, divergent push, dirty tree, etc.).

The merge guard: the branch must be the head of an open pull request whose
every check run is green, and every check named in `required-checks.json`
must be among them. When the rebase moved the commits (the target advanced),
the rebased branch is pushed and the merge stops until CI has run on it, unless
the rebase changed record files only (todo, techdebt, lessons, plans, ADRs).
