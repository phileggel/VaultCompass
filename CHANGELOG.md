# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- add optional ISIN field alongside ticker reference
- two-field web lookup with ISIN format gate
  SearchPanel now exposes one input + submit per path (ISIN and
  Keyword). Loading spinner and inline error anchor to the field
  that triggered the action so the other path stays usable; new
  presenter maps InvalidIsinFormat to a field-local copy key.
- explicit ISIN/keyword lookup mode + format validator
  Auto-routing by query shape is replaced by an explicit
  `mode: LookupMode { Isin, Keyword }` so the FE can drive path
  selection. ISIN path adds ISO 6166 validation (WEB-016) and a
  tighter 3-venue cap per share class (WEB-050e). FE two-field UI
  follows in a subsequent commit.
- show per-account global value on accounts list
  ACC-021 surfaces CSH-094's per-account economic value (cash + same-
  currency priced holdings) on the Accounts list, alongside the name +
  frequency columns. New use_cases/account_summary/ wraps Account with
  total_global_value via a dedicated IPC, keeping the existing
  get_accounts cheap for dropdown callers that don't need the value.

### Fixed

- i18n ModalContainer close-button aria-label (F24)
- thread i18n locale through formatIsoDate + compact price cell
- rename Open Balance CTA to Add a position
- guard account_details_view hooks with try/catch fallback
  usePriceModal.handleSubmit and useAccountDetails.fetchDetails called
  the gateway without try/catch — a throw would leave isSubmitting /
  isLoading stuck true and never set an error. Both now match the
  canonical pattern used by the sibling hooks (UNKNOWN_ERROR fallback,
  flag cleared in finally). Closes two 2026-05-23 techdebt entries.
- clip Dialog to viewport so tall modals scroll inside
  E2E in CI's 800x600 viewport reported the AddAsset submit button
  as "not interactable" — Dialog had no max-height and content
  overflowed the screen, with the footer pushed below the viewport.
  max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)] + flex-1/min-h-0 lets the content scroll
  within bounds; matches the FormModal pattern.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- add ETP class for OpenFIGI umbrella securityType
  ETFs like Amundi PEA MSCI World (FR001400U5Q4) come back from OpenFIGI
  with securityType=ETP, which our previous mapping didn't know — user
  saw "Unknown type". OpenFIGI uses ETP as umbrella for ETF/ETN/ETC and
  doesn't expose the distinction, so we surface the same umbrella. Users
  can edit the class manually for finer granularity.
- raise lookup caps to 10/share-class, 30 total
  Previously the per-share-class cap of 3 hid the primary venue for
  single-company queries (e.g. ASML keyword showed London/Xetra/Milan
  but never Amsterdam — its actual primary). Bumping per-class to 10
  and total to 30 lets the user scroll a longer list and pick the
  right venue. Spec WEB-022 updated to match.

### Fixed

- strip diacritics from OpenFIGI lookup query
  OpenFIGI's name index is unaccented — "Société Générale" returns 0
  hits while "Societe Generale" returns 100. NFD-normalize the query
  before WEB-014 routing so accented inputs find their matches. Handles
  all Latin diacritics (é/è/ê/ç/à/ô/ñ/ü/…) via combining-mark removal.
  Spec adds WEB-015 alongside existing WEB-014 routing rule.
- map LO and SQ OpenFIGI codes to XLON/XMAD
  OpenFIGI exposes some venues under two short codes — LSE as both LN
  (lit primary) and LO (consolidated), Madrid as both SM (Continuous)
  and SQ (BME composite). Mapping only one in each pair left priority-
  walker picks of LO/SQ unlabelled (e.g. ENGIE 0LD0, SANTANDER SAN).
- F27 fetch-price presenter for refresh hooks
  useRefreshGlobalPrices + useRefreshAccountPrices were switching on
  result.error.code directly, bypassing F27. Adds fetchPriceErrorToI18n
  covering FetchAccountAssetPricesError + FetchAllAssetPricesError, plus
  a SnackbarMessage type at src/ui/format/i18n.ts for hooks that dispatch
  via snackbar rather than rendered error state.
- F27 pipeline → account_details + transactions
  Hooks in account_details + transactions still stringified typed errors,
  losing Oversell.available, InsufficientCash.current_balance_micros,
  and InvalidDateFormat.date payloads at the hook layer. Adds two per-BC
  presenters covering HoldingTransactionError + AssetPriceError unions
  with payload interpolation in en/fr; boyscout-fixes useEditPrice.
- restore F27 typed-error pipeline across 3 features
  Hooks were stringifying typed errors to `error.${code}` before the F27
  presenter ever ran, dropping per-variant payloads (InvalidExchange,
  InvalidCurrency). Adds three per-BC presenters + canonical I18nMessage
  at src/ui/format/i18n.ts, payload interpolation in en/fr, and
  exhaustive variant tests across assets, categories, accounts.
- pin sqlx-cli to 0.8.6 to match sqlx 0.8
  taiki-e/install-action with `tool: sqlx-cli` (no version) drifted to
  0.9.0, which requires DATABASE_URL for `prepare --check` even with
  SQLX_OFFLINE=true. Match the runtime dep version explicitly.

L-001 (Tauri bundler walks src/bin/) and L-002 (unpinned install-action
tools drift) codified in docs/lessons.md.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- stop Tauri bundler probing for phantom .exe
  Tauri's NSIS bundler walks src-tauri/src/bin/ on disk and expects
  every entry to produce a bundled .exe — required-features gating
  (b89b343) didn't help, breaking v0.11.0 and v0.12.0 Windows builds.
  Moving the dev tool to src-tauri/dev/ keeps it buildable while
  hiding it from the bundler. Mirrors PatientManager d79a245.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- exchange picker in Add/Edit forms + i18n
  Picker is feature-scoped Zustand cache, session-static — curated list
  loads once via gateway on first mount. Boyscout: modals now `t()` the
  error string so InvalidExchange (and pre-existing variants) display.
- add Exchange value object + BE wiring
  Exchange is a first-class domain field, decoupled from any web provider.
  Inbound `openfigi_mic_to_exchange` and outbound `exchange_to_stooq_suffix`
  mappers form the anti-corruption layer; providers stay swappable.
- MKT auto-fetch frontend UI + settings toggle (#30)
- MKT auto-fetch backend (Stooq) + source field (#29)
- surface primary listing per share class
  OpenFIGI's keyword search never returns the primary venue for a name
  search; it floods results with OTC and trade-reporting duplicates of the
  same share class. Adds a second /v3/mapping call to recover the primary
  listing, and isolates the opinionated venue-priority and exchange-name
  tables in a dedicated processor module for auditability.

### Fixed

- surface OpenFIGI 429 as typed RateLimited error
  Reversed WEB-025's "intentionally closed" decision: 429 deserved
  distinct user-facing copy ("wait and retry") instead of the opaque
  generic network error that hid the actual fix from the user.
- honour Asset.exchange in Stooq symbol derivation
  The price-fetch orchestrator was still calling the bare-ticker helper,
  so the picker had no production effect for non-US assets. Wired to
  derive_stooq_symbol_with_exchange + integration test guards the path.
- small fixes bundle (CVE + domain hardening) (#25)
- add error.DatabaseError key for new gold infra wire shape
  Frontend reviewer caught the missing key. Without it, the new
  { code: "DatabaseError" } wire shape from PR 6's Category CRUD
  migration would have rendered the raw key string to users on any DB
  failure. Surgical fix tied directly to the wire-shape change.
- preserve typed AccountNotFound in ensure_cash_for
  PR 3 routed buy/sell/correct/cancel through ensure_cash_for_typed,
  which opaqued every error to Infrastructure(Unknown) — including the
  in-account AccountNotFound that buy_holding etc. previously surfaced
  as typed AccountNotFound { account_id }. Promote ensure_cash_for to
  typed Result; opaque only true cross-BC asset-side failures.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- cash + priced
  same-currency holdings, no FX.
- `OpeningBalance` rejected on the Cash Asset (CSH-061).
- Migration `202605060001` is documentation-only —
  `transaction_type` is TEXT.

Frontend

- New Deposit / Withdrawal modals + hooks mirroring Buy/Sell, with a
  shared `validateCashForm` helper (CSH-021/031). Withdraw + Buy/Edit
  surface `InsufficientCash` inline with localised balance + currency
  (CSH-081); `useTransactions` formats the payload-bearing variant
  centrally.
- Account Details: Deposit (always) and Withdraw (gated on cash > 0)
  buttons in the header, Global Value tile, and a no-cash banner.
- Cash row variant in the active holdings table — sorted to the top
  (CSH-092), no cost-basis / avg-price / realized-pnl cells, with
  inline Deposit / Withdraw actions (CSH-091).
- Suppress system Cash Assets in the Asset Manager and the Add / Edit
  / Open-Balance asset selectors (CSH-015/018/061), and the Cash
  Category from category lookups (CSH-017).
- Transaction list renders Deposit / Withdrawal type labels (CSH-101).
- New `useAccountDetailsView(accountId)` hook absorbs modal state +
  handlers + derived flags so `AccountDetailsView.tsx` is pure JSX +
  one hook call.
- New cash, validation, and `error.*` i18n keys in EN + FR.

### Fixed

- stop shipping generate_bindings dev tool in installer
  The dev-only generate_bindings bin was packaged into Windows NSIS
  installers since at least v0.8.x. Gate it behind a Cargo feature so
  cargo build skips it; recipes and scripts opt in via
  --features generate-bindings. Release workflows also strip any stale
  binary restored from rust-cache before tauri-action runs.
- reject mutations on system Cash Asset (CSH-016)
  update_asset / archive_asset / unarchive_asset / delete_asset now reject
  inputs whose target asset has class == Cash with CashAssetNotEditable.
  archive_asset and delete_asset additionally surface NotFound for unknown
  ids (the new guard loads the asset). FE filtering (CSH-015/018) already
  prevents these calls in practice; this closes the direct-IPC gap.
- the scrim covers the whole viewport at 50%
  black + blur, and in a standalone preview there is no real content
  behind it, so dark-mode shots looked near-black and misrepresented
  the component. The panel-only pattern lets dark mode show the proper
  m3-surface-container tone behind the dialog.
- Documented the panel-only pattern in CLAUDE.md (project-specific
  visual-proof note).
- Kit-level update tracked separately on phileggel/claude-kit.

- wire afterTest screenshot hook in wdio.conf.ts
  Captures a PNG to screenshots/e2e-failures/ on every failed test for
  post-mortem diagnosis. Filename: {suite}-{test}-{ISO-timestamp}.png.
  Also fixes pre-existing bug where SIGINT handler set undeclared `exit`
  instead of `cleanShutdown`, causing spurious "exited unexpectedly" logs.
- make E2E suite green for WebKit/HeadlessUI
  Replace flaky `*=` selectors with XPath, redesign tests around the
  HeadlessUI ComboboxField boundary (no automation in WebKit), and add
  data-testid + aria-label to modal close buttons. New ADR-007 documents
  the combobox limitation. All 18 E2E tests pass.
- remove spin buttons from numeric transaction inputs
- replace hardcoded placeholders in remaining modals
- replace hardcoded placeholders in buy and sell modals
- replace string-sentinel with typed AccountNotFound error

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- improve web lookup with Derivatives class and exchange
  Add Derivatives AssetClass (default_risk=5); maps Warrant/Option/Future/Rights (WEB-023)
  Add exchange field to AssetLookupResult; resolved from exchCode via static table (WEB-049)
  Sort results by AssetClass priority before 10-item truncation (WEB-048)
  Two-line result row in SearchPanel: code+name / type·exchange (WEB-031)
  Add formatAssetClass() presenter for human-readable class labels

### Fixed

- address PR review comments on exchange_code and i18n

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- use constant default for created_at ALTER TABLE
  SQLite rejects non-constant expressions (e.g. datetime('now')) in
  ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN. This caused all app launches to fail with
  "Database initialization failed" since 2026-04-26.

Existing rows get the epoch sentinel '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z', which
sorts before any real timestamp and is correct for ORDER BY date, created_at.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- isolate E2E tests with an ephemeral SQLite database
- implement frontend for TRX-042–058
  OpenBalanceModal + useOpenBalance hook; openHolding in gateway;
  Open Balance button in AccountDetailsView (TRX-055);
  OpeningBalance edit support in EditTransactionModal (TRX-051);
  i18n en+fr; TRX-046 future-date guard; presenter + edit modal
  unit tests (TRX-051–054)
- implement opening-balance transaction type

### Fixed

- change default tracing log level from debug to info
- harden wdio.conf.ts and align buy_sell note field
- Append Date.now() suffix to E2E_DATA_DIR to prevent collision on concurrent runs
- Wrap mkdirSync in try/catch with actionable error message
- Rename `exit` variable to `cleanShutdown` to avoid shadowing process.exit
- Change note: null to note: "" in seedBuy for Tauri 2 null-deserialization safety
- apply reviewer findings across frontend and backend
- apply reviewer findings and update docs
  Reviewer findings: Math.floor (TRX-047), TRX-055 button always visible,
  TRX-046 edit date guard, TRX-058 snackbar test, mount log removed,
  gateway.test.ts moved to feature root, i18n placeholder keys.
  Docs: plan ticked, roadmap row, todo tech-debt items, UL confirmed.
- use platform native root CAs for OpenFIGI HTTPS on Windows
- resolve error.undefined on account creation and window visibility

## [0.8.1] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed

- show empty state before error in account/asset/category tables

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- add web lookup dialog before Add Asset form
  Introduces WebLookupModal, SearchPanel, useWebLookupSearch, useWebLookupModal hooks.
  Extends useAddAsset with prefill?: AssetLookupResult (WEB-041/042).
  Wires AssetManager to open WebLookupModal instead of AddAssetModal.
  Adds i18n keys (en + fr) for the web_lookup block.
- add search_asset_web command and OpenFIGI client
- add price history CRUD commands and modal

  Use tokio::try_join! for parallel count queries in service
- add UoW infrastructure foundation (Phase 5)
- add auto-record price checkbox and settings toggle
  Settings page gains a global auto-record toggle persisted in
  localStorage. Buy/sell/edit forms gain a RecordPriceCheckbox
  whose default snapshots the global toggle on create (always OFF
  on edit, MKT-052). 18 new tests; 6 new i18n keys (en + fr).
- auto-record asset price from transaction
  CreateTransactionDTO gains record_price: bool. RecordTransactionUseCase
  wires Arc<AssetService>; orchestrator upserts AssetPrice in the same
  DB tx and notifies after commit (MKT-055..062). 9 new tests.
  Frontend hooks default to record_price=false (UI wiring lands next).
- add Settings page with language override
- auto-detect system language and locale-aware number format
- add locale-aware number formatting for display values
- add market price entry and unrealized P&L display
- persist last visited section across sessions

  the asset. Mirrors ArchiveAssetUseCase pattern. SQLx cache updated.
- add buy-from-holding-row modal
  Buy (+) on holding row opens BuyTransactionModal instead of navigating to /transactions/new.
  Mirrors SellTransactionModal pattern (TRX-041). Modals moved to account_details/ (use-case boundary, fixes F22).
  IconButton gains success/error tonal variants. HoldingRow extracted. try/finally, useMemo, useCallback fixes.
- add currency field to Account entity
  Migration, domain, repository, service, API, bindings, account form,
  transaction modals. Exchange rate field now compares asset.currency vs
  account.currency (TRX-021, SEL-036).
- add archive eligibility guard (OQ-6)
  HoldingRepository.has_active_holdings_for_asset checks quantity > 0 across all accounts.
  ArchiveAssetUseCase guards then delegates to AssetService, keeping contexts isolated.
- implement sell transaction frontend with P&L display
- implement sell transaction backend with realized P&L
- improve account list page UX
- move back button and title into shell header

### Fixed

- abort E2E run when tauri build fails in onPrepare
- address reviewer-infra findings on E2E infrastructure
- guard isSubmitting reset in finally blocks
- reject archived-asset sell on update
- clear DateField parent state on invalid typed input
- replace hardcoded strings with i18n keys
- fix SEL-011 account field and SEL-026 average price retention
  SEL-011: add read-only Account field to SellTransactionModal
  SEL-026: preserve average_price (last known VWAP) when holding quantity reaches zero, per TRX-040

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- add Settings page with language override
- auto-detect system language and locale-aware number format
- add locale-aware number formatting for display values
- add market price entry and unrealized P&L display
- persist last visited section across sessions

  Mirrors SellTransactionModal pattern (TRX-041). Modals moved to account_details/ (use-case boundary, fixes F22).
  IconButton gains success/error tonal variants. HoldingRow extracted. try/finally, useMemo, useCallback fixes.
- add currency field to Account entity
  Migration, domain, repository, service, API, bindings, account form,
  transaction modals. Exchange rate field now compares asset.currency vs
  account.currency (TRX-021, SEL-036).
- add archive eligibility guard (OQ-6)
  HoldingRepository.has_active_holdings_for_asset checks quantity > 0 across all accounts.
  ArchiveAssetUseCase guards then delegates to AssetService, keeping contexts isolated.
- implement sell transaction frontend with P&L display
- implement sell transaction backend with realized P&L
- improve account list page UX
- move back button and title into shell header

### Fixed

- reject archived-asset sell on update
- clear DateField parent state on invalid typed input

- fix SEL-011 account field and SEL-026 average price retention
  SEL-011: add read-only Account field to SellTransactionModal
  SEL-026: preserve average_price (last known VWAP) when holding quantity reaches zero, per TRX-040

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- add /transactions/new page as DDD entry point
- add transaction list page
- add get_asset_ids_for_account command
- add toast notification infrastructure
- reorder nav, translate labels, add About modal
- Reorder drawer: Accounts, Assets, Categories
- Translate nav labels via i18n (nav.\* keys)
- Replace /about route with AboutModal triggered from sidebar
- Add app description and license to About modal
- add TanStack Router with hash history
  ACD-011: replace useState-based nav with URL routing.
  Routes: /assets, /accounts, /accounts/$accountId, /categories, /about.
  Back button and direct linking now work via hash history.
- implement account details view with cost basis
  ACD-010 to ACD-041: holdings list, cost basis, loading/empty/error states
- add purchase transactions with VWAP and server-side total
  Backend: CreateTransactionDTO omits total_amount (TRX-026); orchestrator
  computes it via compute_total. Frontend: computeTotalMicro for display
  preview only. VWAP recalculation on create/update/delete (TRX-030).
  Atomic DB transaction for transaction + holding upsert (TRX-027).

### Fixed

- correct VWAP cost basis calculation
- Fix double MICRO division in VWAP numerator
- Add fees to cost basis via total_amount (TRX-030)
- Align VWAP formula with TRX-026 total_amount
- Update spec TRX-030 to reflect correct formula
- fix asset prefill on buy modal and action.select i18n key
  AddTransactionModal was always mounted so useState init ran once with
  undefined prefillAssetId; fix via key prop on modal (TRX-011).
  fees default changed from "0" to "" to match quantity placeholder.
  action.select i18n key added to fr and en locales.
